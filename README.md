ABSTRACT = {This article focuses on modeling of an Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Generator (AFPMG). The authors analyzed selected variants of disk generators, including coreless stator constructions and with iron core ones, also taking into account the Permanent Magnet (PM) arrangement in order to show the way to obtain the optimal machine characteristics based on analytical equations. In addition to the full model, which takes into account the higher harmonics of the magnetic field distribution, the paper presents a simplified mathematical model developed for generator operation cases such as standalone, connected to a 3-phase power grid and loaded with a diode rectifier. The analytical and finite-element method (FEM) calculations were performed as well as laboratory tests to confirm the correctness of presented model assumptions.},
